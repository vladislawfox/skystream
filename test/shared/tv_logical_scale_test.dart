/// A television reports about 960 dp of width whatever its panel is, so the
/// same layout that breathes on a laptop is drawn at twice the relative size
/// on a set. This hands the tree more logical pixels and paints the result
/// smaller, so a third more of everything fits on the screen.
///
/// What this replaces was `MediaQuery(devicePixelRatio: 1.0)`, which reads
/// like it clamps the density and does nothing of the sort: layout is in
/// logical pixels and that field is one widgets read, not one that resizes
/// anything. The first test here is the one that would have caught it.
///
/// Every panel size below is a real one. 960x540 is what an Android TV
/// reports - a 1080p set at density 2 and a 4K set at density 4 both land
/// there - and it is the case an earlier version of this file got backwards:
/// the guard skipped exactly the screen the widget exists for, so on a set it
/// did nothing at all.

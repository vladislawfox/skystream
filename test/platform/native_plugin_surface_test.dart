/// What native code every platform build registers, pinned.
///
/// A dependency is added once, in `pubspec.yaml`, usually for one platform —
/// but it is bought for all five, and the bill is paid at **registration**, not
/// at use. `generated_plugin_registrant` constructs every registered plugin at
/// startup, so "no Dart code calls this" does not stop a plugin doing whatever
/// it likes the moment the app launches. Nothing else in this repo records what
/// each platform is carrying.
///
/// That is the mechanism behind both of the worst bugs this project has
/// shipped, and neither was visible to the rest of the suite:
///
///   * `screen_brightness` was added for the mobile player's touch rail. It
///     silently bought a Windows plugin that drives DDC/CI — I²C over the
///     display cable — at its registrar and again on `WM_CLOSE`, for a feature
///     `vlc_player_controls.dart` returns early from on desktop. Users reported
///     SkyStream resetting their monitor's brightness.
///   * `flutter_inappwebview` was added for the Cloudflare bypass. It silently
///     bought a Windows plugin whose constructor builds a WinRT dispatcher
///     queue, a Graphics.Capture probe, a hardware D3D11 device and a
///     compositor before any Dart runs — none of which this app ever uses.
///
/// This test is the ledger. It does not judge; it makes a change to the native
/// surface **impossible to make silently**. When it fails, the diff names the
/// plugin, and someone decides — on purpose, in the pull request — rather than
/// finding out on release day on a platform they cannot build.
///
/// Editing the expected sets is a normal part of adding a dependency. What is
/// not normal is editing them without reading what the new plugin does at
/// registration on the platform you do not build.
///
/// This runs on any host: `flutter pub get` resolves the full five-platform
/// graph regardless of which machine it runs on, and `flutter test` runs
/// `pub get` first, so the manifest is always fresh.

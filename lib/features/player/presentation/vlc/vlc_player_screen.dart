  ///    an add enables what it just added - disabling before the batch
  ///    achieves nothing, and [_openAttempt] disables after it.
  ///  * The same adds again, later. libVLC 3 queues an add-slave to the input
  ///    thread, so `addSubtitle` returns before the ES exists; and on the
  ///    first open of a session the controller has no engine yet and replays
  ///    the whole batch on attach, long after the open chain has finished.
  ///  * libVLC choosing an EMBEDDED track for itself as the media opens, on
  ///    that same thread.
  ///
  /// None of the three is observable except as a snapshot naming a track,
  /// which is this - and every native sends one on ESAdded as well as on the
  /// ordinary tick.
  ///
  /// The rule stands down for this media the moment the viewer opens the side
  /// panel ([_openPanel]), and that bound is the whole design. The Subtitles
  /// tab, the device file picker and the online search all live inside the
  /// panel and the panel has exactly one entry point, so until it has been
  /// opened the viewer has no way to select a subtitle at all: anything
  /// selected in that window is the media selecting for itself, and turning it
  /// off cannot be overruling anybody. From the moment it opens, nothing here
  /// touches the subtitle track again, so a pick stands.
  ///
  /// Bounding on the panel rather than on the first frame is deliberate. A
  /// frame proves the controls exist, not that the adds have landed: on a
  /// first open they land at attach, which can be either side of the first
  /// frame, and a rule that had already closed would let the side-car it was
  /// meant to catch stay on.
  ///
  /// What this deliberately does NOT do is remember a pick across media. A
  /// failover, a recovery, a rendition step-down and the next episode each
  /// re-arm it, and that media starts with subtitles off again.
  ///
  /// For the next episode that is right. For the other three it is a known
  /// wrong, recorded here rather than glossed: they reopen the same content
  /// with no user action, so a subtitle the viewer turned on by hand vanishes
  /// mid-episode. Auto is not symmetrical here either, and the argument that
  /// it is does not survive: Auto only overwrites a pick on a source that
  /// ships side-cars AND matches the preferred language, and a source with
  /// embedded subtitles alone - a direct MKV, a torrent, most debrid links -
  /// returns from the batch untouched and keeps the viewer's track. So Off is

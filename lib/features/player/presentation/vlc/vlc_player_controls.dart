/// Chrome for the VLC engine.

/// The design is shared with the media_kit overlay: [PlayerTopBar],
/// [PlayerBottomBar], [PlayerIconButton] and the scrubber are the same
/// widgets, so a design change lands on both paths at once.
///
/// [ChromeVisibilityController] owns the auto-hide timer; nothing here starts
/// or cancels one. The controls are ordinary focusable widgets in reading
/// order inside one FocusTraversalGroup and native traversal moves between
/// them; the three nodes this State owns route nothing. Position is consumed
/// inside [VlcProgressBar], so a tick rebuilds the scrubber and nothing else.
///
/// On macOS and iOS this chrome sits over a platform view, not a texture.
/// Flutter backs every layer over a platform view with its own IOSurface,
/// sized to the layer and rebuilt when the layer comes or goes, so a
/// window-sized opacity layer torn down on each hide produces black frames.
/// controls_layer_shape_test.dart holds the consequences: one setState per
/// user-visible mode change, a [RepaintBoundary] around anything drawn over
/// the video, no BackdropFilter or ImageFiltered over the video at all, and no
/// single opacity or filter layer spanning both bars - each bar fades on its
/// own so each layer is bar-sized.
///
/// The spinner keys on `isStalled || isBuffering`, never on the libVLC state
/// alone: only Android reports `buffering` mid-play, while VLCKit and the
/// desktop backends stay `playing` through a rebuffer.
///
/// Buttons whose backend does not exist here, or that the current device
/// cannot honour, are absent rather than disabled: the screen passes null for
/// anything unavailable. The five list buttons follow the same rule through
/// [panelTabs], so focus can never land on a control whose list does not
/// exist.

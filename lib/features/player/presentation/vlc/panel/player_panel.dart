/// Opening moves focus onto the row that is selected now, not row one. Closing
/// returns focus to the control that opened the panel, which falls out of the

/// focusable buttons rather than a scrollable [TabBar], and nothing here
/// hand-routes an arrow key.
///
/// Data is live: the screen publishes a [PanelData] through a
/// `ValueListenable` and the panel rebuilds from it, so a failover, a late
/// probe or a torrent poll moves the tick, the chips and the badges in place.
/// The row a list opens on and focuses is decided once, from the value at
/// open, and a later value never scrolls or refocuses.
///
/// Every size, inset and text alpha comes from [PlayerPanelMetrics], installed
/// once here and read off the context by the rows, badges, subheaders and tabs
/// below. The television ramp is about 1.2x the type, a 48 dp overscan inset
/// and paddings that make a row and a tab one whole focus target.
///
/// The panel is drawn over a platform view. It animates in with a
/// [SlideTransition] - a transform, not a window-sized opacity layer - and its

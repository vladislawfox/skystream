/// The player it replaces offered a next arrow and nothing else: to reach

/// start again. The list is the same one [effectiveEpisodes] navigates, so what
/// this offers and what the next arrow does can never disagree — including the
/// dub filter, which is why episode 5 appears once on a series carrying both a
/// subbed and a dubbed copy of it.
///
/// WATCH PROGRESS: sixty rows of an anime are otherwise visually identical, and
/// the details screen answers "which of these have I seen" for the very same
/// list. So a seen episode's still is dimmed the same 28 % black the details
/// screen dims it by and carries a `Watched` chip, and a part-watched one gets
/// a bar across the foot of its still. It is read-only here: this is a list a
/// viewer is picking from mid-playback, not the place to change history.
///
/// It arrives as an [EpisodeProgressLookup] asked once per built row, never as
/// a map on [PanelData] — see the typedef for why.

/// Layout and painting are untouched: a taller box here would push every card
/// taller, and a hit area cannot extend past an ancestor's bounds, so the
/// growth has to happen at the row rather than around each chip.
///
/// That ancestor rule also makes the band ASYMMETRIC in practice. The action
/// row is the last child of the card's Column, so a pointer below it is
/// already outside the Column and is rejected before it reaches here; only the
/// upward half is live. A tap in the gap below the chips therefore falls
/// through to the card itself, which is the intended behaviour for Play and a
/// known rough edge for Download. The maths below stays symmetric because it
/// is the correct general rule, not because both halves fire here.

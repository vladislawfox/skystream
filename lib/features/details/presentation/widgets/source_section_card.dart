/// A details screen offers streams from two independent plugin systems -
/// SkyStream providers and Nuvio scrapers - and neither is subordinate to the
/// other. They used to be drawn as different *kinds* of thing: the SkyStream
/// results sat in a quiet tonal card while Nuvio was a saturated primary
/// button, which read as one feature and one call to action rather than two
/// peers. Giving both the same container is what makes the ranking between
/// them a matter of order alone.

/// The two are peers in billing, not in behaviour. SkyStream results are
/// searched as the page builds and shown inline; Nuvio resolves behind a tap,
/// because running every scraper on page load is expensive.

/// A durable, de-duplicating outbox for the tracking writes that must survive
/// a network flap.
///
/// The terminal tracking events - "this episode is watched", "playback stopped
/// here" - are emitted at exactly the moment a phone is most likely to lose the
/// network, and a lost write loses the episode permanently while the app's own
/// list still shows it watched.
///
/// [SyncOutbox.enqueue] writes the entry to storage before it attempts the
/// network, so a process kill between the two costs nothing.
///
/// Delivery is recorded per service, not per event: Trakt's `scrobble/stop` is
/// not idempotent, so an entry carries the set of service id-prefixes that have
/// already confirmed it and a retry only goes to the remainder.
///
/// Enqueue de-duplicates on (op, item url, season/episode, episode url,
/// session). The session component has to be unique per viewing, not per
/// screen, or the second of two viewings loses its write to the first.
///
/// Only terminal events are queued. `scrobbleStart` and `scrobblePause`
/// describe where the user is right now, so replaying a two-hour-old "paused at
/// 12%" would overwrite a newer resume point with stale data; losing one of
/// those costs nothing.
///
/// The queue is bounded by [maxEntries], [maxAgeMs] and [maxAttempts], and a
/// queued stop expires far sooner than a queued mark
/// ([SyncOutbox.maxStopAgeMs]). `markWatched` is a monotone fact;
/// `scrobbleStop` carries a position and the wire format has no field for
/// when, so Trakt stamps `paused_at` with its own receipt time and a late
/// replay overwrites the point a newer viewing, often on another device,
/// already recorded.

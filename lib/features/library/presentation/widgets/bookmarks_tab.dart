/// Hands the D-pad highlight back to the cell a viewer opened, when they come
/// back to a lazily built collection — a grid, or a rail.
///
/// A route's focus scope remembers its own focused child, but that restoration
/// stops working the moment the collection rebuilds its cells while the viewer
/// is away: a bookmark toggled on the details page leaves the list one item
/// shorter, `SliverChildBuilderDelegate` sees a different [ValueKey] at that
/// index, the tile element is torn down and its [FocusNode] disposed, and the
/// next D-pad press starts from the top-left card.
///
/// The node lives here, owned by the collection's [State], so it outlives any
/// number of tile rebuilds. A per-tile node is disposed by the very rebuild it
/// would have to survive, and calling `requestFocus` on it afterwards throws.
/// One node, not one per cell: only one cell is ever the return target, and a
/// map keyed by item would have to be pruned on every list change.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// late final _focusReturn = GridFocusReturn(onTargetChanged: () => setState(() {}));
/// // ... in the item builder:
/// Card(focusNode: _focusReturn.nodeFor(item.id), onTap: () => _open(item));
/// // ... after the push future completes, on a focus-driven device only:
/// _focusReturn.restoreTo(item.id);
/// ```
/// The cell must forward the node to whatever draws its focus ring
/// (`CardsWrapper` via `MultimediaCard.focusNode` here) and must not dispose
/// it: the node belongs to this object, which disposes it with the collection.
///
/// Nothing here is specific to bookmarks. Lift it into `lib/shared/widgets/`
/// as soon as a second collection needs it.

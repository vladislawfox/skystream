///
/// What Netflix and Prime Video do, because what they do works: the card grows
/// a little, takes a **thin neutral border**, and gets a shadow under it. That
/// is all.
///
/// What was here before was three accent-coloured layers at once - a 3 dp
/// `colorScheme.primary` ring, an 18 % primary wash painted *over* the poster,
/// and a primary glow behind it. Any one of them reads; all three at once
/// recolour the artwork they are supposed to be pointing at, which is why no
/// ten-foot interface of this kind uses an accent for focus. A neutral border
/// separates from every poster, because a poster can be any colour but the
/// gap between two cards is always the page.
///
/// Two layers, and both are kept in the tree in *both* states:
///  * the **border and shadow**, painted with [BorderSide.strokeAlignOutside]
///    so the stroke sits entirely outside the card. An inside border eats
///    `2 * width` from the artwork and the card visibly shrinks as it gains
///    focus;
///  * nothing over the child at all. The wash is gone.
///
/// Returning a decoration rather than `null` in the unfocused state is
/// deliberate: a null decoration makes [Container] drop its [DecoratedBox],
/// which changes the shape of the element tree on every focus change and
/// forces the whole card subtree - including the network image - to be
/// re-inflated.

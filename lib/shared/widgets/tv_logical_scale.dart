/// Gives a television more logical pixels to lay out in.
///
/// An Android TV reports about 960x540 dp whatever its panel is: a 1080p set
/// at density 2 and a 4K set at density 4 both land there, deliberately, so
/// one layout serves both. A desktop window of the same physical size reports
/// nearer 1800 dp. Nothing in this app scales itself up on a television - it
/// draws the same dp everywhere - but with half the canvas the same 36 dp
/// button covers twice the fraction of the screen, four posters fit across
/// instead of eight, and a hero title that fits one line on a laptop wraps.
///
/// This hands the tree [kTvLogicalWidth] dp of width and scales the result
/// back up to fill the panel, so the browsing UI breathes the way it does on a
/// desktop while every physical pixel is still used.
///
/// WHAT IT REPLACES. `main.dart` used to do this:
///
/// ```dart
/// MediaQuery(data: mq.copyWith(devicePixelRatio: 1.0), child: result)
/// ```
///
/// with a comment saying it clamped the density "for standard scaling". It
/// never did. Layout is in logical pixels and the dp-to-pixel mapping belongs
/// to the engine's `RenderView`; [MediaQueryData.devicePixelRatio] is a value
/// widgets *read*, not one that resizes anything. Its one real effect was on
/// `createLocalImageConfiguration`, which resolves asset variants off it - so
/// forcing 1.0 asked a 4K panel for 1x artwork.
///
/// NOT THE PLAYER. The video is an Android platform view by default
/// (`VlcPlayerConfig.defaultAndroidRenderer`, so libVLC keeps its hardware
/// decoder). Flutter sizes a platform view from its logical size and the
/// device pixel ratio, without folding in an ancestor transform, so a scaled
/// one is rendered at the pre-scale resolution and stretched: 4K video
/// upscaled from a 720-line surface. [TvLogicalScale] therefore asks
/// [playerRouteIsOnTop] and steps aside while the player is up - the player's
/// chrome has a ten-foot ramp of its own and wants none of this.
